<h1>Day-to-Day Planner</h1>

<p>Moreover, as an added help, the planner color-codes past times (grey), present time (red) and future time (green) for the user's benefit!</p>

<h1>Initial Usage</h1>

<p>The user may type into the rows what s/he has planned for that time-block. Click the save button to the right-hand side will save this event to the browser's Local Storage based on the time it is in, allowing the user to close out the application, log back in, and still see the event in the same block. Typing a different event and re-saving will cause the event in the Local Storage to be re-written, reflecting the change.</p>
